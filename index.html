			<p>Syracuse continues to face a problem the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/lead/protect-your-family-sources-lead#:~:text=In%201978%2C%20the%20federal%20government,is%20usually%20not%20a%20problem." target="_blank">federal government sought to fix in 1978</a>: lead paint is still found in homes and commercial buildings 46 years after the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/" target="_blank">Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a> banned its use. </p>

			<p>Lead paint was eventually cycled out of use, but that didn’t mean it stopped existing. The city of Syracuse is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_New_York" target="_blank">over 200 years old,</a> and in a town that had the <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/news/2023/12/syracuse-ranks-no-2-among-big-us-cities-for-child-poverty-even-as-rate-falls.html#:~:text=Syracuse%27s%20overall%20poverty%20was%20also,to%20the%202022%20census%20numbers." target="_blank"> second worst child poverty rate in the United States in 2022</a>, many people do not have the means to check for lead paint, let alone remove and replace it.</p>

			<p>It wasn’t until 2020 that the city <a href="https://mysouthsidestand.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SyrLeadAbatementControlORD_Final.pdf" target="_blank">codified an ordinance</a> that put the responsibility on local government to hire lead paint inspectors and removers for buildings. This meant that when homes and buildings were tested for safety, lead paint inspection was now a part of the test.</p>
			<p>In the ordinance, they attributed this new strategy to the harm lead can inflict on humans, with their first finding being that “lead poisoning poses a serious public health threat to children and adults in the city of Syracuse.”</p>

			<p>While this has been a <a href="https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/healthy_homes/healthyhomes/lead#:~:text=When%20lead%20is%20absorbed%20into,and%20in%20extreme%20cases%2C%20death." target="_blank">well-known fact</a> for decades, the ordinance created a more organized approach to fighting the lead paint crisis in Syracuse. However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, building inspectors were encouraged not to enter people’s homes.</p>

			<p>Mujahid Muhammad, a longtime home inspector who rose to the Lead Paint Coordinator of Syracuse, has helped create an organized approach to attack the lead paint problem. He said that as of August 2022, the city government began enforcing new standards.</p>

			<p>“I think they started training people on being lead inspectors and that sort of thing. And once we got up and running, the idea was that we were going to go full court press and start adding that component into our home inspections” said Muhammad.</p>

			<p>Since then, more data has been recorded on lead paint violations, with the city recording over 1,300 since August 2022.*</p>

			<p>They are only in the beginning stages of recording, and Muhammad believes this has been one of their setbacks. “I think that we started off a little rough, not having that (lead paint violation) in our documentation and not having those preliminary conversations. And now that's a big part of what's going to come, to get a rental registry, certificate of adequacy, or any of those things that are now included in the conversation.”</p>

			<p>However, diligence takes time. Of the over 1,300 lead paint violations, 45% of the cases are still open. This likely means the city has identified lead paint inside or outside a home or commercial building, but owners have not gone to public or private contractors to remove the lead paint.</p>

			<p>With a more detail-oriented outlook, the city wants to be more proactive when considering what buildings may contain lead paint. “The city isn't doing XRF (x-ray fluorescence) testing for a specific surface by surface lead. We are instead presuming if it was built before 1978, which a lot of the city's housing inventory is, that you're going to need to get clearance” said Muhammad. </p>
			<p>As a former inspector himself, Muhammad understands the importance of knowing where to look, citing the variations of landlord types in Syracuse.</p>
			<p>“Usually it comes down to human factors. If you encounter a landlord who is very diligent about maintaining their properties, usually across the broad swath of their properties aren't going to see too many problems” said Muhammad.</p>
			<p>“If you see a home that has a high volume of tenant movement, you're going to see more problems just because of the gap in between ownership and renting.”</p>
			<p>Adding lead paint to the registries and certificates will hopefully lead to more accountability for landlords and homeowners taking over buildings or homes built before 1978. Reports from the rental registry make up about 35% of reported lead paint violations.</p>

			<p>Owners of many properties are the primary targets of this new approach since many violations can go unreported and unnoticed. In July of 2023, the state Attorney General’s Office sued a Syracuse landlord in connection to <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/health/2024/03/lead-paint-settlement-syracuse-landlord-promises-to-fix-19-homes-after-11-kids-poisoned.html" target="_blank">11 children being poisoned </a> by lead paint.</p>

			<p>While the city is bound to get some pushback from lackluster landlords or unwilling tenants, Muhammad wants to be as open as possible on all sides.</p>

			<p>“I'm a firm believer that code doesn't have to be an adversarial process. So for me, there's no finger-pointing. It’s collaborative, whether it's landlords, tenants, property managers, or whoever. I always want to include them in the conversation and make sure that everybody is working together.”</p>
